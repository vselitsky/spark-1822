# mdns

Host-level systemd template service that publishes subdomain aliases via Avahi mDNS. Lets `netdata.spark-1822.local`, `whatever.spark-1822.local`, etc. resolve on the LAN without DNS or `/etc/hosts` entries on each client.

Unlike the other stacks in this repo, this is **not** a Docker compose stack — Avahi's API is on the host's DBus and aliases must be published by a process the host's `avahi-daemon` trusts.

## Files

```
mdns/
├── sparky-mdns-alias            # bash script — publishes one alias
├── sparky-mdns-alias@.service   # systemd template unit

```

## Install

```bash
cd /opt/mdns
./install.sh
```

This copies:

| Source | Destination |
|---|---|
| `sparky-mdns-alias` | `/usr/local/bin/sparky-mdns-alias` (mode 755) |
| `sparky-mdns-alias@.service` | `/etc/systemd/system/sparky-mdns-alias@.service` (mode 644) |

and runs `systemctl daemon-reload`. Re-run after edits.

## Add an alias

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now 'sparky-mdns-alias@netdata.spark-1822.local'
```

Verify from a LAN client:

```bash
dig @224.0.0.251 -p 5353 netdata.spark-1822.local   # raw mDNS query
# or, on the same box:
avahi-resolve -n netdata.spark-1822.local
```

## Remove an alias

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now 'sparky-mdns-alias@netdata.spark-1822.local'
```

## Uninstall everything

Stops + disables every active alias instance, removes the script and unit file, reloads systemd:

```bash
cd /opt/mdns
./uninstall.sh
```

The repo files under `/opt/mdns/` stay in place so a future `./install.sh` brings everything back.

## How it works

The script discovers the host's primary IPv4 (whichever address Linux uses as the source for outbound traffic to a global address) and runs:

```
avahi-publish -a -R <alias> <ip>
```

`avahi-publish` registers the name on the local Avahi daemon for as long as the process runs. systemd keeps it running (with `Restart=always`), so the alias survives across reboots and avahi-daemon restarts.

The unit is a template — `%i` (the part after `@` in the unit name) is passed to the script as the alias to publish, so one unit definition supports any number of aliases.

## Limitations

- Pins to the IP discovered at service start; if the LAN IP changes (DHCP reassignment), restart the unit. A DHCP hook to do this automatically is a possible follow-up.
- mDNS resolution requires the client to support mDNS (Linux with `avahi-daemon` or `systemd-resolved`, macOS, iOS, Windows 10+).

# llama-cpp

[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) inference server, GPU-accelerated on the GB10 via CUDA. Serves an [OpenAI-compatible API](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md) and a small web UI at `https://llama.${CADDY_DOMAIN}` (fronted by [`caddy/`](../caddy/)).

Set up as the workaround for Ollama not being able to pull `gpt-oss-safeguard:120b` (upstream issue: ollama/ollama#16121).

## Supported model formats

- **GGUF only.** The single input format llama.cpp's server can load directly. Single-file or multi-part split GGUF (the model in `envs/gpt-oss-safeguard-120b-hf.env` is a 2-file split — llama.cpp opens the first file and picks the second up by naming convention).
- **Not supported as direct inputs:** HuggingFace `safetensors`, PyTorch `.bin`, ONNX, ggml v1/v2 (legacy).
- **HF safetensors models can be converted to GGUF** with [`convert_hf_to_gguf.py`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/convert_hf_to_gguf.py) shipped in the llama.cpp repo. The 4 safetensors models in this host's HF cache (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B`, `Jackrong/Qwen3.5-27B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Reasoning-Distilled`) are **not** loaded as-is — convert first, or pull a ready-made GGUF (look on HF for `<author>/<repo>-GGUF` published by `bartowski`, `lmstudio-community`, `unsloth`, etc.).
- **Quantization formats supported inside GGUF**: `Q2_K`–`Q8_0`, `F16`, `F32`, `IQ*`, OpenAI's `MXFP4`, and others. See <https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md>.
- **Architecture support** is broad and tracked here: <https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp#description> (search the README for the list of supported model families).

## Topology

`llama-cpp` runs as a single container on the shared `traefik` Docker network (defined by the `traefik/` stack; Caddy joins the same network as backup). Whichever proxy is up reaches the container over that network for external traffic. The container also publishes its API on the host's loopback interface at `127.0.0.1:8080` for direct host-side curl/benchmarks — not reachable from the LAN. Set `HOST_PORT=<n>` in the variant file if 8080 is taken.

### GPU exclusivity

`-ngl 999` puts every model layer on GPU and keeps them resident (~65 GiB VRAM for the default model). The GB10 has 124 GiB total, but **Ollama lazily loads its own models on demand into the same VRAM**, so you can't have both engines active at once without one OOMing the other. Hence `restart: "no"` here — this stack is manual-start. To use llama.cpp:

```bash
docker compose -f /opt/open-webui/docker-compose.yml stop ollama
cd /opt/llama-cpp && make up ENV=<name>
```

To go back to ollama:

```bash
docker compose -f /opt/llama-cpp/docker-compose.yml down
docker compose -f /opt/open-webui/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Three model sources are wired into the container:

| In-container path | Source |
|---|---|
| `/root/.cache/llama.cpp/` | llama.cpp's own download cache (named volume `llama-cpp-cache`, filled via `MODEL_URL`) |
| `/ollama/models/blobs/sha256-<hex>` | Ollama-cached GGUF blobs (external volume `open-webui-ollama`, read-only) |
| `/root/.cache/huggingface/hub/...` | HuggingFace CLI cache on the host, bind-mounted read-only |

The entrypoint picks the model in this order: **`MODEL_PATH`** (any mounted file) → **`MODEL_OLLAMA`** (resolved against the `/ollama` manifest store at start, e.g. `gpt-oss-safeguard:20b`) → **`MODEL_URL`** (downloaded into the cache volume).

```

## Configure

Two layers:

- **`.env`** (host-wide) — shared across every variant. `LLAMACPP_TAG` (image pin), `HF_CACHE_HOST`, `HF_TOKEN`, default `MODEL_ALIAS` / `CTX_SIZE` / `N_GPU_LAYERS`. Bootstrapped from `.env.example` by `make up` on first run; gitignored thereafter.
- **`envs/<name>.env`** (per-variant) — just the model selection: `MODEL_PATH` (or `MODEL_OLLAMA` / `MODEL_URL`), `MODEL_ALIAS`, and any per-variant overrides.

`make up ENV=<name>` chains both via `docker compose --env-file .env --env-file envs/<name>.env up -d` — variant wins where it specifies a value, falls back to `.env` otherwise. Edit `HF_TOKEN` once in `.env` and every variant picks it up.

Raw `docker compose ps / logs / down` reads only `.env`:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f llama-cpp
docker compose down
```

### Pinning the image

The `ggml-org/llama.cpp` registry publishes a per-build tag for each upstream commit — `server-cuda-b<NNNN>` for the CUDA-server / multi-arch image. Per-build tags are immutable on the registry, so just pinning the tag is enough; no digest-pin needed.

Browse builds at <https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pkgs/container/llama.cpp> (filter to tags starting with `server-cuda-b`) and set `LLAMACPP_TAG=server-cuda-b<NNNN>` in `.env`.

If you want belt-and-suspenders digest pinning (e.g. to guard against a hypothetical registry compromise), resolve the manifest digest for that specific tag:

```bash
TOK=$(curl -s 'https://ghcr.io/token?service=ghcr.io&scope=repository:ggml-org/llama.cpp:pull' | jq -r .token)
curl -sI -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" \
    -H 'Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json' \
    "https://ghcr.io/v2/ggml-org/llama.cpp/manifests/server-cuda-b9151" \
    | grep -i docker-content-digest
```

Then set `LLAMACPP_TAG=server-cuda-b9151@<that-digest>`.

## Deploy

Prereq: a proxy stack (`traefik/` primary, or `caddy/` backup) running on `:80`/`:443`. The shared `traefik` Docker network must exist (owned by `traefik/`).

```bash
make list                                  # show available variants
make up ENV=gpt-oss-safeguard-120b-hf      # start that one
docker logs -f llama-cpp                   # tail (first run downloads the model)
```

Equivalent without Make:

```bash
docker compose --env-file envs/<variant>.env up -d
```

Once healthy, the server is at `https://llama.${CADDY_DOMAIN}`:

- Web UI — open in browser.
- OpenAI-compatible API:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://llama.spark-1822.local/v1/models
  curl -k https://llama.spark-1822.local/v1/chat/completions \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"model":"gpt-oss-safeguard-120b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
  ```

## Changing the model

Switch to another variant with `make up ENV=<name>` (or `docker compose --env-file envs/<name>.env up -d`). The `llama-cpp-cache` volume preserves previously-downloaded URL-pulled models, so swapping back is fast.

### Adding a new variant from the HuggingFace CLI cache

The host's `/opt/hf/.cache/huggingface/` is mounted read-only at `/root/.cache/huggingface/`. Files downloaded via `huggingface-cli download <repo> <file>` or `hf download <repo> <file>` live at:

```
/root/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--<org>--<repo>/snapshots/<rev>/<file>
```

Create `envs/<name>.env`:

```
MODEL_PATH=/root/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--<org>--<repo>/snapshots/<rev>/<file>.gguf
MODEL_ALIAS=<friendly-name>
CTX_SIZE=8192
N_GPU_LAYERS=999
```

### Adding a new Ollama-backed variant

The mount + resolution stay wired up even though no variant file ships with one. `ollama pull <name>:<tag>` on the host puts the GGUF into the `open-webui-ollama` Docker volume; then drop:

```
MODEL_OLLAMA=<name>:<tag>
MODEL_ALIAS=<friendly-name>
CTX_SIZE=8192
N_GPU_LAYERS=999
```

into `envs/<name>-<tag>.env`. The entrypoint resolves the right blob path at start by reading the Ollama manifest at `/ollama/models/manifests/registry.ollama.ai/library/<name>/<tag>` — no hardcoded digests.

### Adding a URL-downloaded variant

Use `MODEL_URL=<https://…>` instead of `MODEL_PATH`. llama.cpp downloads the file into the `llama-cpp-cache` volume on first start and reuses it after.

## Upgrade

Bump `LLAMACPP_TAG` in `.env` to a newer build (e.g. `server-cuda-b<NNNN>` — see "Pinning the image" above for browsing builds), then:

```bash
docker compose --env-file envs/<name>.env pull   # resolve image tag from the variant
make up ENV=<name>                                # restart on the new image
```

## Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f llama-cpp
```

## Uninstall

```bash
docker compose down
docker volume rm llama-cpp-cache   # destroys cached model downloads
```
